With the development of mobile Internet, which provides a variety of convenient features and has profoundly changed people's life. Meanwhile, Internet of things, smart home and other related industries are also in rapid development stage, how to provide reliable and secure wireless access to these intelligent devices in a green economy way is particularly important, although the use of cellular and WIFI can solve most of the access problem, but due to spectrum limitation and potential health problem caused by radiation forcing people to look for new technology. At the same time as a new generation of green efficient light source, LED is very popular in the lighting market,  its market share is expected be more than 52 \% in 2021. LED-based indoor visible light communication meets an unprecedented development opportunity. In this paper, adaptive transmission in the field of VLC based on OFDM modulation techniques are studied, including channel estimation, adaptive algorithms and so on.

At first, This paper introduces the research background and summarizes the development history of visible light communication. Then briefly introduces the basic principles of visible light communication, including system model, the channel characteristics, electro-optical and optical-electro conversion device, etc. According to the actual situation, visible communication channel is modeled as a linear channel in this paper. The optical OFDM is also studied, including the DC-biased optical OFDM(DCO-OFDM) and Asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM(ACO-OFDM). Then, a peak to average power ratio(PAPR) reduction technology for ACO-OFDM called RoC-ACO-OFDM is proposed. 

Subsequently, discussed the common method OFDM channel estimation, focusing on pilot-based approaches, the systematic study of the LS channel estimation method based on least squares method, a method based on the minimum mean squared error MMSE and MMSE improved method based on two LMMSE and SVD decomposition method; and then combined with visible light communication system design examples using ZC sequence as a pilot, compared the above-mentioned method performance in the visible channel of simulation methods, found that although the LS channel estimation method performance slightly inferior to LMMSE and SVD algorithm, but its implementation is much more simple, so this issue will be in the hardware design using LS channel estimation; and finally discuss the OFDM system SNR estimation methods to analyze the estimation methods and EVM pilots based method, EVM method, although the need for additional overhead, but its estimated value is more consistent practical system, recommended to use this method in visible light adaptive transmission system.

Then, this article discusses the bit and power allocation algorithm for OFDM systems, describes the theoretical basis of adaptive transmission - the Shannon information theory and injection theorem; then introduces OFDM adaptive transmission areas of the three most classic algorithms, optimal Hughes- Hartogs algorithm, Chow algorithm and Fischer algorithm, a detailed description of these algorithms derivation and implementation steps, and through simulated and compared their performance differences were found in the visible light communication channel BER performance under their criteria in BA or less; the final analysis Suitable subcarrier SNR correlation larger SBLA algorithm, because the visible channel itself is low-pass and natural fit SBLA algorithm applications, and further use of visible light communication channel characteristics, proposed to adapt the linear interpolation for power distribution Improved-SBLA algorithm , the simulation found that the improved algorithm reduces the amount of feedback on the basis of computational complexity, BER performance and SBLA considerably, indicating improved algorithm is feasible.

Finally, based on the previous chapters explain the visible light communication principle and adaptive transmission theory, we introduced this topic corresponding hardware platform. First, an overview of the entire hardware platform, including the parameters of their choice based on a variety of devices, and outlines the baseband processing transmitter and the receiving end; and then focus on baseband described with adaptive technology is closely related to the modulator adaptive parameter generation, soft demodulation three modules; and finally shows a physical map of the entire hardware platform.
